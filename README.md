# FFXIV Firmament Tracker Plugin for the Elgato StreamDeck

StreamDeck is an external LCD key macro device that allows the installation of plugins to improve productivity.

Final Fantasy XIV is a MMORPG video game.

## Description

`FFXIV Firmament Tracker Plugin` reads the FFXIV Ishguardian Restoration [Builders' Progress Report](https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/ishgardian_restoration/builders_progress_report) and displays server progress percentages on your StreamDeck.

The website updates every hour, so the plugin updates every 1m after the hour and on initialization.

You can drag and drop multiple plugins to display more than one server if desired.

Clicking the button will open up the Builders' Progress Report web page.

Compatible with Windows.
